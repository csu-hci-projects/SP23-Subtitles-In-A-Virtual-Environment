This method of subtitles has the subtitles placed below the characters.

### Method 2: Character/Comic Subtitles

<!-- ![Dynamic Subtitles](images/dynamic_subtitles.png) -->

This method of subtitles adds a plane behind the subtitles and a portrait image of the speaking character.

### Method 3: Head Mounted Display Subtitles

<!-- ![Follow-the-Gaze Subtitles](images/follow_the_gaze_subtitles.png) -->

This style of subtitle is fixed to the Head Mounted Display. The subtitles are always visible as the viewer looks in any direction.
